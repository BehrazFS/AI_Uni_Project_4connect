# Connect-Four-AI-Agent-Final-Project-for-Artificial-Intelligence

This project was completed as the final assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course (Fall 1403) under the supervision of Dr. Mirroshandel.
The project implements intelligent agents capable of playing the classic **Connect Four** game. The game logic was provided, and the focus of the project was on designing and implementing smart agents using AI techniques.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Design and implement an **intelligent agent** that selects optimal moves in Connect Four.
* Use **AI algorithms** and design a custom **heuristic evaluation function**.
* Support both:

  * **Human vs AI**
  * **AI vs AI** matchups.

## ðŸ§  AI Features

* **Move selection algorithm** based on game tree search (e.g., Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning).
* **Heuristic evaluation** considers:

  * Number of connected pieces.
  * Blocking opponent's winning opportunities.
  * Creating future winning chances.
* Configurable difficulty/strategy levels.

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Evaluation

The agent was tested against both human players and other agents. Performance was evaluated based on:

* Win rate.
* Strategic depth.
* Response time.
